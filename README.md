# unity-ml-flight

This is meant to be a fun little project to teach myself Unity and Reinforcement Learning.

Originally, I was inspired after watching Top Gun: Maverick with my family, and I wanted to do something fighter jet / flight related. At the same time, I came across [Primer's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ) and [b2studio's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIcGc8tDHYZ3vY3NcS8JXaQ?app=desktop) videos.
These motivated me to not only mess around in Unity and learn more about reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, I knew nothing about both so I had to do some learning, and I figured a project + watching tutorials would help me.

Many of the prefabs, materials, and flight controller/physics I got from others because my end goal was reinforcement learning flight rather than learning everything about Unity.
